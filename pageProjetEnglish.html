<h3>Version Validation Tool</h3>
<span class="project-lang">Technologies used: Python, XML, JSON, PowerShell</span>
<p>During my internship at Tech Research, a company specializing in digital printers and mail inserting machines, I had the opportunity to apply my computer science skills acquired at the IUT of UGA. My internship lasted from April 15 to July 5, 2024, and was dedicated to developing a crucial tool for validating software versions of a digital printer front end.</p>

<p>My main mission was to transform an existing PowerShell solution into a more flexible and intuitive application, using Python for its efficiency and libraries suitable for developing tests and user interfaces. Thanks to Visual Studio Code, I was able to rewrite and optimize the code while maintaining a modular and clear structure, essential for keeping test consistency across controller versions.</p>

<p>The tool I developed allows the user to create and manage test suites through a user-friendly interface. The first part of the interface facilitates the creation of JSON files detailing the tests to be performed, while the second part allows navigation through these files to launch and view test results.</p>

<p>I used Python libraries such as unittest to organize tests by case and suite, lxml to manipulate XML files necessary for the tests, and urllib as well as shutil to efficiently manage system resources and files.</p>

<p>This project allowed me to enhance my programming autonomy while closely collaborating with my tutor to overcome technical challenges. Research and adaptation to new libraries enriched my documentation and technical skills while confronting me with strict professional requirements outside my usual academic environment.</p>

<p>This experience at Tech Research was a valuable immersion in applied software development, strengthening my ability to innovate and deliver solutions tailored to the specific needs of a constantly evolving tech industry.</p>

    <h3>Dispatch Sorting Projects</h3>
    <span class="project-lang">Technologies used: Java</span>
    <p>This project involves implementing sorting algorithms in one week to sort a list of dispatches by category using code written in Java. <br>
    It is an academic project done in a team of two. We had various lists of dispatches that needed to be sorted efficiently. Efficiency was judged based on two criteria: the number of comparisons and the execution time of the algorithm. The goal was to compare different sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort. An English report was also required, detailing the difficulties encountered, the different algorithms and solutions tested to optimize them as much as possible, and the group's organization. We had to write this report using computer science vocabulary. This project provided a glimpse of what team projects in a company can require.</p>

    <h3>Database Project</h3>
    <span class="project-lang">Technologies used: PostgreSQL</span>
    <p>This is an academic project. It aims to create a PostgreSQL database from data contained in a CSV file, working in groups of two. <br>
    Then, using the database, we had to answer questions and submit a report with the SQL queries that provided the necessary information to answer those questions. <br>
    The data studied concerned the Titanic disaster, specifically its passengers, victims, and survivors. First, we created a database by filtering the useful data and organizing it into different tables to categorize the information. <br>
    Next, we retrieved precise information and calculated it from available data, minimizing the number of different queries. We used subqueries for this. <br>
    Finally, we had to interpret the queries and deduce how many people could have been saved under the best conditions and why this number was not achieved.</p>

    <h3>Running Event Creation and Management Application Project</h3>
    <span class="project-lang">Technologies used: Java, JavaFx</span>
    <p>This is a university project completed by a group of 5 people. The concept involves creating an offline application for creating and managing running events from scratch. This project encompasses all stages, from concept research to the final realization of the application. It required significant teamwork and organization to distribute tasks among team members. Initially, we defined the requirements and constraints.<br>
    Once the constraints were identified and the requirements defined, we developed the design document. This document includes various diagrams, such as use case diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams. It also contains the description of use cases and alternative scenarios for these cases. All these diagrams served to define a roadmap for the project's realization, and we also had to establish the management of the application's creation.<br>
    To do this, we created logical diagrams outlining the steps to follow during an action within the application, such as entering the event name or registering a runner.<br>
    An interface design document was also created, consisting of several wireframes and personas.<br>
    Thanks to all these documents, the application was programmed during a dedicated one-week sprint. The functions and object classes of the application were coded in Java, while JavaFX was used for the interface.<br>
    This project is one of my largest projects to date and allowed me to experience teamwork with a larger group of people over a longer period. I was able to see each stage of the project's realization.</p>
